# weather-app-1.0
Weather forecast with www.weatherapi.com
the application shows the weather in the selected city with the appropriate description. 
it is possible to enter any city or choose from several suggested ones, there is a mobile version.
By default it shows my hometown.
It was implemented in 3 ways: via XMLHttpRequest wrapped in a promise, via fetch api, via acync/await syntax, I stopped at the last option.
All 3 variations you can find in script.js.
Native JS, CSS, HTML.
